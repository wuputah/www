I've created a [simple DNS tool](http://dns.herokuapp.com/) that allows you to easily link DNS results to share with others. Using a third-party tool is a great way to show that the DNS settings are not being affected by your local network, but most third-party tools are riddled with advertising and unclear tool names, with some even charging a membership to access some of their tools. My tool uses (and displays in the result) the command line used to generate the results instead. While not everyone will be familiar with these different commands, users can still experiment to learn and discover more about these valuable tools.

The tool is available at [dns.herokuapp.com][1]. The site is written using the Sinatra framework and the [code is open source](http://github.com/wuputah/dns-tools).
