If you're a recruiter (that is, anyone looking to hire me), please read this
before contacting me, or you risk losing a potential lead forever.~

<p>As you are probably aware, software engineers are in fairly high demand.
Those with experience in Ruby on Rails are even more so. Demand is easily
outstripping supply, and that means I get contacted a lot, even though I am not
actively looking for a new position.</p>

So, before sending me an email, please note the following:

1.  I am gainfully and happily employed. This means that your position needs to
    be very enticing just to consider the position. In order to do this, you
    must be able to provide me:

    *  The name of the company I would be working for.
    *  What I would specifically be working on.
    *  What it's like to work at the company, in terms of work expectations,
       office environment, and the corporate culture.
    *  What I might expect for compensation and benefits.
    *  All the standard information you would include in a job posting.

    If you're unable to provide this information **by email**, whether
    it's due to contractual obligations, because your business model depends
    on withholding information (or you don't trust me), or because you
    haven't done your homework and don't know, then you should not bother
    contacting me. You may think that phone calls are a "better way" to
    share information, but I can't have phone calls every other day with
    recruiters when I'm not even looking for a job.

2.  Do not contact me by email and then "follow up" with a phone call unless I
    have specifically requested to speak with you. Unsolicited email followed by
    a unsolicited phone call is likely to get you blocked. I _may_ respond to
    your email if you have provided the above information and if I'm interested.
    Please don't email me over and over again.
3.  Don't make me do your work for you. You need to sell me on the job.
    [Know your recruit.][2] If you want to know more about my
    professional experience, check out my [LinkedIn profile][3].

All that being said, I don't want this to be taken the wrong way. I'm
happy to be contacted, but you're not doing me--or yourself--any favors
if you can't tell me what the job is about.
