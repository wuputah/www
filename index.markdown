Hi, I'm JD. I work with [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) at [Hydra](https://hydra.so). I've previously worked at
[Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), [WegoWise](https://www.wegowise.com),
my own Ruby on Rails consulting company, and [Agora Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WB_Games_New_York). I studied
Computer Science at [RPI](https://www.rpi.edu/).

While my most important language is [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_management), I've programmed in
Ruby, SQL, Rust, C, C++, PHP, Python, Perl, Lua, and, of course, JavaScript. I've managed open source projects
including [pg_duckdb](https://github.com/duckdb/pg_duckdb), [Hydra Columnar](https://github.com/hydradatabase/columnar),
[rack-timeout](https://github.com/zombocom/rack-timeout), and [heroku-bouncer](https://github.com/sharpstone/heroku-bouncer).
I've also made small contributions to many projects such as [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
and [nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx).

I didn't say it would be easy,
